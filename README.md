Quantum Rule-Based Systems to solve Reinforcement Learning problems

This repository contains the source code for the article "Automatic evolutionary design of Quantum Rule-Based Systems and applications to Quantum Reinforcement Learning". If you plan to use this code, please cite:

(article under review)

- The file BinaryCHC.py contains a Python implementation of the binary CHC evolutionary algorithm.
- The file QRBS.py implements the Quantum Rule-Based System.
- The file Evaluator.py implements the fitness evaluation function of the QRBS for Quantum Reinforcement Learning using TensorFlow Quantum v0.7.0.
- The file Wrappers.py include the preprocessing wrappers explained in the article for each studied environment.
- The remaining files QRBS_*.py contain the main files executed for the experiments in the article.

The source coude will be publicly available once the article has been accepted for publication.
